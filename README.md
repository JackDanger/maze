# Maze.rb

This is an example of depth-first maze generation. Run it like so to see
how a 2-dimensional array turns into a maze when it's explored via a
stack in random order.

## Usage:

Just rewrite this yourself. Seriously, it's a fun exercise. Do it in,
like, Lisp or something. But if you want to run _this_ version, save the
`maze.rb` to your computer and run:

    ruby maze.rb 20 20 > maze.html && open maze.html
